,Django-Rest-Framework. Updating nested object,"<p>I'm having a problem of updating a nested object.</p>

<p>So I have a model which structure is similar to this one:</p>

<pre><code>class Invoice(models.Model):
    nr = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class InvoiceItem(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.FloatField()
    invoice = models.ForeignKey(Invoice, related_name='items')
</code></pre>

<p>I need to create child objects from parent, and what I mean by that, is to create <code>InvoiceItems</code> directly when creating an <code>Invoice</code> object.
For this purpose, I've wrote the following serializers:</p>

<pre><code>class InvoiceItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    invoice = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=Invoice.objects.all(), required=False)
    class Meta:
        model = InvoiceItem


class InvoiceSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    items = InvoiceItemSerializer(many=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Invoice

    def create(self, validated_data):
        items = validated_data.pop('items', None)
        invoice = Invoice(**validated_data)
        invoice.save()
        for item in items:
            InvoiceItem.objects.create(invoice=invoice, **item)
        return invoice
</code></pre>

<p>Up till now, the create/read/delete methods work perfectly, except the <code>update</code>.
I think the below logic should be correct, but it misses something.</p>

<pre><code>def update(self, instance, validated_data):
    instance.nr = validated_data.get('nr', instance.nr)
    instance.title = validated_data.get('title', instance.title)
    instance.save()

    # up till here everything is updating, however the problem appears here.
    # I don't know how to get the right InvoiceItem object, because in the validated
    # data I get the items queryset, but without an id.

    items = validated_data.get('items')
    for item in items:
        inv_item = InvoiceItem.objects.get(id=?????, invoice=instance)
        inv_item.name = item.get('name', inv_item.name)
        inv_item.price = item.get('price', inv_item.price)
        inv_item.save()

    return instance

Please make use of .get method to iterate through the elements and the return value must be a asyncArray (not a regular array)

blank = true

Then added this code to my command button

Private Sub command1_Click()
checkEmpty
If blank = true Then
Msgbox ""a text box is empty""
Else
Msgbox ""Text box has text""

 I now want to filter the fullNameList based on if it exists in the search list but I am not doing a direct match but rather a ""starts with"" match. So in my example, after filtering I would want this to be the results
 
 ""Joe Thompson""
 ""Bob Jones""
 ""Bob Smith""
 ""Joe Williams""
 (as you can see the record starting with Billy was not included as it didn't start with any items in the search list)
 
 I could do this ""manually"" like this:
 
  var resultList = fullNameList.Where(r=> r.StartsWith(""Joe"") || r.StartsWith(""Bob""));
 but I want it to be dynamic (as there might be more items in the search list added in the future).
 
 I could do this in a loop like this:
 
  var resultsList = new List<string>();
 
  foreach (var item in searchList)
  { 
  resultsList.AddRange(fullNameList.Where(r=>r.StartsWith(item));

Also, I would like to extend the application by storing and retrieving this kind of data on mobile apps for Android and iOS.

Is there any other way to store that type of data in some files so it can be uploaded to some cloud storage like Dropbox ? After storing it on Dropbox, all I would have to do is sync the app with dropbox, get the files and read/write stuff.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the answers they helped me a lot. The best solution for me is to replace SQL Server with SQlite, as Gabe Sechan commented.

,Is it possible to increase Floating Action Button size on Android?,"I'm working on an application and we want to increase the size of our floating action button on larger devices.

The problem is that floating action button comes only in two size (mini and normal).

First, I tried to set a custom android:layout_heightand android:layout_heightto my fab but it didn't work. Well, the whole layout did actually got bigger but a border appeared around the fab and the background wasn't fully transparent.

Desperate for a solution I created my own circle button view and replaced the floating action button. But that's not good enough. I won't have the cool ripple effects or everything else a fab has.

After that, I started reading Floating Action Button's source code but it gets complex really fast so I decided to take a break and post my question here.

So, does anyone know how to increase the size of a floating action button?

As I've been doing research on this error and still can't come about on how to fix this. I am also intrigued and curious on how I would prevent this issue from coming about again. I am using the Cloud 9 IDE. I am using an initialization file and will be sanitizing the files. It is stating that there need to be a semi colon after my `'host' => '127.0.0.1',`

I have also tried a PHP validator / Lint. Still is buggy and giving me the error.

 <p>That sounded promising, so I fired up GHCI and started experimenting:</p>
 
 <pre><code>Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap
 ap :: Monad m =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type fromMaybe
 fromMaybe :: a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap fromMaybe
 ap fromMaybe :: (b -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; b -&gt; b
 </code></pre>
 
 <p>The type of <code>ap fromMaybe</code> certainly looks correct, and a couple of experiments seem to indicate that it has the desired behaviour as well.</p>
 
 <p>But <strong>how does it work?</strong></p>
 
 <p>The <code>fromMaybe</code> function seems clear to me, and in isolation, I think I understand what <code>ap</code> does - at least in the context of <code>Maybe</code>. When <code>m</code> is <code>Maybe</code>, it has the type <code>Maybe (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code>.</p>
 
 <p>What I don't understand is how <code>ap fromMaybe</code> even compiles. To me, this expression looks like partial application, but I may be getting that wrong. If this is the case, however, I don't understand how the types match up.</p>
 
 <p>The first argument to <code>ap</code> is <code>m (a -&gt; b)</code>, but <code>fromMaybe</code> has the type <code>a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a</code>. How does that match? Which <code>Monad</code> instance does the compiler infer that <code>m</code> is? How does <code>fromMaybe</code>, which takes two (curried) arguments, turn into a function that takes a single argument?</p>

 <p>Since it seems like a general-purpose function, I wondered if it wasn't already defined, so <a href=""https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/684418608454352896"">I asked on Twitter</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bitemyapp/status/684467784793886720"">Chris Allen replied</a> that it's <code>ap fromMaybe</code>.</p>
 
 <p>That sounded promising, so I fired up GHCI and started experimenting:</p>
 
 <pre><code>Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap
 ap :: Monad m =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type fromMaybe
 fromMaybe :: a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap fromMaybe
 ap fromMaybe :: (b -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; b -&gt; b
 </code></pre>
 
 <p>The type of <code>ap fromMaybe</code> certainly looks correct, and a couple of experiments seem to indicate that it has the desired behaviour as well.</p>
 
 <p>But <strong>how does it work?</strong></p>
 
 <p>The <code>fromMaybe</code> function seems clear to me, and in isolation, I think I understand what <code>ap</code> does - at least in the context of <code>Maybe</code>. When <code>m</code> is <code>Maybe</code>, it has the type <code>Maybe (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code>.</p>
 
 <p>What I don't understand is how <code>ap fromMaybe</code> even compiles. To me, this expression looks like partial application, but I may be getting that wrong. If this is the case, however, I don't understand how the types match up.</p>
 
 <p>The first argument to <code>ap</code> is <code>m (a -&gt; b)</code>, but <code>fromMaybe</code> has the type <code>a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a</code>. How does that match? Which <code>Monad</code> instance does the compiler infer that <code>m</code> is? How does <code>fromMaybe</code>, which takes two (curried) arguments, turn into a function that takes a single argument?</p>

,Best practices to test protected methods with PHPUnit,"found the discussion on Do you test private method informative.
 
 I have decided, that in some classes, I want to have protected methods, but test them. Some of these methods are static and short. Because most of the public methods make use of them, I will probably be able to safely remove the tests later. But for starting with a TDD approach and avoid debugging, I really want to test them.
 
 I thought of the following:
 
 Method Object as adviced in an answer seems to be overkill for this.
 Start with public methods and when code coverage is given by higher level tests, turn them protected and remove the tests.
 Inherit a class with a testable interface making protected methods public
 Which is best practice? Is there anything else?
 
 It seems, that JUnit automatically changes protected methods to be public, but I did not have a deeper look at it. PHP does not allow this via reflection.","php

 p=&n;, if I am not wrong, assigns the address of variable n (say, 3000) to p.
 So cout<<p<<"" ""<<*p; would output 3000 and 23 respectively.
 My doubt here is that suppose we did something like this:
 p=5; i.e. assigning a numerical value to a variable designed to hold memory locations, what would happen?
 Is the variable moved to the memory location '5' (most likely not) or is the pointer just converted to an 'int' and made to hold the value 5? I would have tried this out myself, only messing with my system's memory made me have second thoughts.
 
 Also, when we declare any variable (suppose int with 2 bytes space), is it stored in a random memory location like 3000, 101, 2700 or something, or is it stored in 0,2,4,etc.? And is the next variable declared stored right in the next one (like 3002, 103 or 2702), or is there some kind of gap in-between?","c++

When using Git, I often find myself doing the following when working in master:

# work work work...
$ git checkout -b temp
$ git commit -a -m 'more work done'
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
# turns out master was updated since my previous pull
$ git checkout temp
# I don't want a merge commit for a simple bugfix
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge temp
$ git push origin master
$ git branch -d temp

,Representing code algebraically,"I have a number of small algorithms that I would like to write up in a paper. They are relatively short, and concise. However, instead of writing them in pseudo-code (à la Cormen or even Knuth), I would like to write an algebraic representation of them (more linear and better LaTeX rendering) . However, I cannot find resources as to the best notation for this, if there is anything: e.g. how do I represent a loop? If? The addition of a tuple to a list?

Has any of you encountered this problem, and somehow solved it?

Thanks.

EDIT: Thanks, people. I think I did a poor job at phrasing the question. Here goes again, hoping I make it clearer: what is the common notation for talking about loops and if-then clauses in a mathematical notation?

class ClassName():

     def __init__(self, master):

       self.run_button.grid(row=4, columnspan=2)

       self.label1 = Label(master, text=""Entry 1"").grid(row=0, sticky=E)
       self.label2 = Label(master, text=""Entry 2"").grid(row=1, sticky=E)
       self.label3 = Label(master, text=""Entry 3"").grid(row=2, sticky=E)
       self.label4 = Label(master, text=""Entry 4"").grid(row=3, sticky=E)

       self.entry1 = Entry(master).grid(row=0, column=1, sticky=W)
       self.entry2 = Entry(master).grid(row=1, column=1, sticky=W)
       self.entry3 = Entry(master).grid(row=2, column=1, sticky=W)
       self.entry4 = Entry(master).grid(row=3, column=1, sticky=W)
I want to then take the 4 entries and pass them through a different function called the_function. All the_function does is print out something based on the values of the 4 entries. So my remaining code looks like this:

def the_function(self, a, b, c, d):
#    Ensure a, b, c, and d are integers, 
#    do some math on the numbers and print something out based on the
#    values of a, b, c and d.

irrelevant_variable = ClassName(root)
root.mainloop()
The function works properly without the GUI but I cannot figure out how to create a button that takes self.entry1 and passes it through as a in the_function.

The directions say you have to use pointers for everything but didn't make it clear if you can make variables then just not use them and make pointers pointing to them or if there literally cant be one regular variable declaration in the program.

I already did the whole assignment by declaring variables then making pointers point to them but just to be safe I'm redoing it with no variables.

The only thing I'm having trouble with is making a for loop with only pointers because there is no variable set to 0 that I can make a pointer point to and get the memory address of 0 to start the counter.

I would just do this:

int i = 0;

int *counterptr = &i;

cout << ""Please input the array values"" << endl;

for (*counterptr ; *counterptr < 10; *counterptr += 1)
{

But since I cant make variable i to point to I don't know how to get the memory address of 0 to use for the pointer. This is what I have right now but I don't know what to make counterptr equal to.

float *maxptr, *minptr, *difference;

,Async/await vs Task.Run in C#,"I am just new to this world of asynchronous stuff.
Please bear with my lack of knowledge.

It is said when a method encounters await ... ""It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it completes, and then returns from the async method.""
I did not get this part.
So does it mean the method still keeps on running synchronously and waits till the awaitable returns and then proceeds with the rest of the method?
If not please explain then why Task.Run is needed to run a method in the background or in a fire and forget manner. I could still be achieved via await also right? i.e.
The method keeps on executing the rest of the statements without waiting for the await to return.
I hope that is similar to a background run approach. Or is not it? I am confused.

If a method is marked with async and await and that in turn calls another method asynchronously in a separate layer that's also marked with async and await ..
then how the the call of the first method that's marked with async and await from a separate method say name ABC should look like?
I do not want to annotate that method to be async/await. So

Task.Run(() => DoWork());
from ABC () is fine without marking it async/await?
Or is it against the principle of asynchrony?

Here is what I am trying to achieve ...

   public IList<CreateCaseOutput> ABC(CreateCaseInput CreateCaseInput,SaveCaseSearchInput SaveCaseSearchInput)
    {
        CaseSQL.getABCParameters(CreateCaseInput, RequestType, out strSPQuery, out listParam);
        var AcctLst = rep.ExecuteStoredProcedure<CreateCaseOutput>(strSPQuery, listParam).ToList();

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(AcctLst.ElementAt(0).o_case_seq.ToString()))
        {
            Task.Run(async () =>
            {
                await DEF(SaveCaseSearchInput, AcctLst.ElementAt(0).o_case_seq);
            }).ConfigureAwait(false);              
        }
        console.writeLine(""After Async called"");
        return AcctLst;
    }

    public async Task<SaveCaseSearchOutput>> DEF(SaveCaseSearchInput SaveCaseSearchInput,Int64? case_key)
    {

            CaseSQL.getDEFParameters(SaveCaseSearchInput, case_key, out strSPQuery, out listParam);
            var AcctLst = await rep.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync<SaveCaseSearchOutput>(strSPQuery, listParam);
            return AcctLst;
    }
DEF which is async/await needs to be called in the background in fire and forget approach from ABC and once fired I want to continue with rest of ABC and run DEF in the background. What's wrong in this fire and forget approach ? If I call

only

DEF(SaveCaseSearchInput, AcctLst.ElementAt(0).o_case_seq); 
instead of

 Task.Run(async () =>
                {
                    await DEF(SaveCaseSearchInput, AcctLst.ElementAt(0).o_case_seq);
                }).ConfigureAwait(false);              
            }
            return AcctLst;

,iOS How to determine what is blocking the UI,"I'm fairly new to iOS development but I'm starting to grasp some of the more complicated concepts. I currently have an application that implements an AVCam to capture video. The AVCam is created on a separate thread, but uses a view that is in my main xib file. When the camera is done capturing, it calls a complete function in my ViewController class. Within the complete function I call a number of other functions that update the UI as well as a few NSLogs. Everything seems to work fine, I see the logs in the console immediately, but the UI takes another 3 seconds to update. I've tried using instruments to find the offending code, but I can't seem to find it. Is there another way to determine what is blocking by UI?

Here is the code called when the recording is complete;

-(void)movieRecordingCompleted{
       [HUD hide:YES];
        NSLog(@""movieRecordingCompleted"");
        [self showModalViewController];
        NSString *pathToMovie = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Documents/Movie.mov""];
        NSLog(@""pathToMovie: %@"", pathToMovie);
        pathToTreatedVid = pathToMovie;
        NSLog(@""File Save Called"");
        UISaveVideoAtPathToSavedPhotosAlbum(pathToMovie, nil, NULL, NULL);
}
Everything is logged immediately, but the progress HUD and the modal view controller don't trigger for about 2 - 5 seconds, it's very strange.

,SQL Statement Help - Select latest Order for each Customer,"Say I have 2 tables: Customers and Orders. A Customer can have many Orders.

Now, I need to show any Customers with his latest Order. This means if a Customer has more than one Orders, show only the Order with the latest Entry Time.

This is how far I managed on my own:

SELECT a.*, b.Id
FROM Customer a INNER JOIN Order b ON b.CustomerID = a.Id
ORDER BY b.EntryTime DESC
This of course returns all Customers with one or more Orders, showing the latest Order first for each Customer, which is not what I wanted. My mind was stuck in a rut at this point, so I hope someone can point me in the right direction.

For some reason, I think I need to use the MAX syntax somewhere, but it just escapes me right now.

UPDATE: After going through a few answers here (there's a lot!), I realized I made a mistake: I meant any Customer with his latest record. That means if he does not have an Order, then I do not need to list him.

print(int(y))

print(""--------- 2.51 * 100"")

print(""--------- 2.51 * 100 * 10 / 10"")
y = x * 100 * 10 / 10
print(y)

x = 4.02
print(""--------- 402.0"")
y = 402.0

print(""--------- 4.02 * 100 * 10 / 10"")
y = x * 100 * 10 / 10

The function below will find all valid folders and add it to a set for further comparison. I'd like to extend this to only return those directories that DO NOT contain files in the out_list. These directories MAY contain sub-directories with file in the out_list. If that's TRUE, I only want that path of the folder name of the valid dir.

# directory = r'w:\workorder'

# Example:
# w:\workorder\region1\12345678\hi.pdf
# w:\workorder\region2\23456789\test\bye.pdf
# w:\workorder\region3\34567891\<empty>
# w:\workorder\region4\45678912\Final.doc

# Results:
# ['34567891', '45678912']

,Debugging the return value of a jQuery selector,"I am looking for a way to debug what a jquery selector returns. I have tried using toString(), but that only ever returns [object Object].

What I am actually trying to do is to attach a callback to radio buttons. And onclick on one of the buttons, I want to submit the enclosing form.

Therefore I try to do something like this:

$("".rating"").stars({
    cancelShow: false,
    callback: function(ui, type, value, event) {
        $(this).closest('form').ajaxSubmit();

,One-step initialization of defaultdict that appends to list?,"It would be convenient if a defaultdict could be initialized along the following lines

d = defaultdict(list, (('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('a', 2),
   ('b', 3)))
to produce

defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'a': [1, 2], 'c': [3], 'b': [2, 3], 'd': [4]})
Instead, I get

defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'a': 2, 'c': 3, 'b': 3, 'd': 4})
To get what I need, I end up having to do this:

d = defaultdict(list)
for x, y in (('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('a', 2), ('b', 3)):
    d[x].append(y)

@time [cohens_kappa3(X, k) for k in 1:15]

,Write global functions to use in all components in angular,"I am working on an angular app where I have around 400 components in different modules, almost all components have one same kind of functionality as mentioned below

There is a sections on many pages which shows a ""How to work section"" which can be closed by users and will remain closed unless they open it again, I have done it with cookies which I set on click on close or open icon but this function is written in a component and this needs to be imported in other components

I want to create a functions somewhere which perform this functionality on click on icon and can be called without importing any component in others.

One way to do it ( as I thought ) could be create a JavaScript function in a file and load it in index file and then call this function on click on close and open icon

Not sure if this is the best way to do this. Hope someone will come up with a better solution.","avascript

,PHP variables not transferring to fwrite,"I am having an issue getting additional variables to be processed through fwrite. When include only the $roll variable, it writes properly. What's happening is the random number from the $roll goes into chat.txt, but when adding $quantity and $dice, then nothing displays (not even the $roll). What I would like to have happen, is the user selects the quantity of dice, the dice type, and then roll. The text from roll should then write to chat.txt.

,Set Google maps coordinates as center screen,"I wrote a script which allows an admin to click on a map (google maps api v3) setting up as many locations as he wants, naming them. That is, clicking on the map shows an information window with a form for naming that location. These locations are saved in a database (LatLng coordinates) and show as markers on the map.

Then, users (admin or not) may choose any of these locations from a select box (by name). Once this is selected, there's an option for showing a map with a marker on the selected location. The marker shows correctly, but I would like the map to be centered in that location. That is, the marker in the center of the screen but, instead, it shows in the extreme upper left corner. Actually, initially, the marker isn't even visible. You have to drag the map up and left a little for it to show.

This is rather strange, as I use the same coordinates for both the marker and the center screen. Here's my code (or the relevant part, at least):

                var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(parseFloat(location.lat), parseFloat(location.ltn));
                var latlng2 = new google.maps.LatLng(parseFloat(location.lat) + 0.025, parseFloat(location.ltn) - 0.05);
                var map = new google.maps.Map($('.modal-body', modal)[0], {
                    'center': latlng,
                    'zoom': 13,
                    'mapTypeId': google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
                });
                var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
                    'position': latlng,
                    'map': map,
                    'title': location.name,
                });
                marker.setMap(map);
Notice how in this sample I don't use the latlng2 value. This is what I tried, but it seems to only work for a given resolution. How can I center the map in those coordinates?

Best regards

,C++ bad_alloc caused by new?,"Fore note: I have read the existing threads in StackOverflow. None seemed to be on my question]

I am looking into the Quake 2 MD2 format. I seem to be getting a bad allocation after new'ing a pointer-array. However, if I do some horrible pointer manipulation, everything is fine. I guess the question is, why am I getting such an exception?

The first ""MD2Model::Load"" works. The one I posted after it gets the exception.

Basic structures :

struct MD2Header
{
    int nIdentifier;
    int nVersion;

    int nSkinWidth;
    int nSkinHeight;
    int nFrameSize;

    int nNumSkins;
    int nNumVertices;
    int nNumUV;
    int nNumTriangles;
    int nNumCmds;
    int nNumFrames;

    int nOffsetSkins;
    int nOffsetUV;
    int nOffSetTriangles;
    int nOffsetFrames;
    int nOffsetCmds;
    int nOffsetEnd;
};

struct MD2Skin
{
    char szName[64];
};

struct MD2TexCoord
{
    short t;
    short u;
};

struct MD2Triangle
{
    short nVertex[3];
    short tu[3];
};

struct MD2Vertex
{
    float   fVertex[3];
    float   fNormal[3];
};

struct MD2Frame
{
    char szName[16];
    MD2Vertex* pVerts;
};
And now, the function that reads the .md2 file:

bool MD2Model::Load( const char* pszName )
{
    FILE* pFile = NULL;

    fopen_s( &pFile, pszName, ""rb"" );
    if( !pFile )
        return false;

    struct stMD2Frame
    {
        float fScale[3];
        float fTranslate[3];
        char szName[16];

    };

    unsigned char pBuffer[30000];
    stMD2Frame* pTmp = (stMD2Frame*) pBuffer;

    fseek( pFile, m_Header.nOffsetFrames, SEEK_SET );
    for( int i = 0; i < m_Header.nNumFrames; i++ )

                pTmp->fScale[0] + pTmp->fTranslate[0];

            m_pFrames[i].pVerts[j].fVertex[2] = -1 * (pTmp->verts[j].nVertex[1] *
                pTmp->fScale[1] + pTmp->fTranslate[1]);

            m_pFrames[i].pVerts[j].fVertex[1] = pTmp->verts[j].nVertex[2] *

nNumFrames       1          int
(I ended up removing my D3DXVECTOR3 structures to see, so it's kinda fugly..)

Alright. So, inside the 'for' loop, is where it blows up. If I were to do it like this:

//  unsigned char pBuffer[30000];
//  stMD2Frame* pTmp = (stMD2Frame*) pBuffer;

    fseek( pFile, m_Header.nOffsetFrames, SEEK_SET );
    for( int i = 0; i < m_Header.nNumFrames; i++ )
    {
        stMD2Frame* pTmp = new stMD2Frame();
        fread( pTmp, 1, m_Header.nFrameSize, pFile );

        m_pFrames[i].pVerts = new MD2Vertex[m_Header.nNumVertices];
        strcpy_s( m_pFrames[0].szName, pTmp->szName );
I get the bad_alloc exception during allocating the ""m_pFrames[i].pVerts"" statement. Sometimes, I don't get it, but I do get the exception when I try to new my D3D class (I'm assuming I'll get it no matter what I new afterwards). My MEM usage is extremely low, so could it be heap corruption?

I actually had to end up doing this during creating my VertexBuffer during animations as well.

Should I end up using vectors? I know they allocate more than needed, but it seems like the (most obvious)[best] way.","c++

,Foobar - Escape Pods Question My code is not passing all tests [closed],"I am trying to complete the google-foobar challenge #4 - escape-pods, my code passes 3 of 4 test cases on google-foobar I am not sure what is wrong with my code. Here is the question.

Write a function solution(entrances, exits, path) that takes an array of integers denoting where the groups of gathered bunnies are, an array of integers denoting where the escape pods are located, and an array of an array of integers of the corridors, returning the total number of bunnies that can get through at each time step as an int. The entrances and exits are disjoint and thus will never overlap. The path element path[A][B] = C describes that the corridor going from A to B can fit C bunnies at each time step. There are at most 50 rooms connected by the corridors and at most 2000000 bunnies that will fit at a time.

For example, if you have:
entrances = [0, 1]
exits = [4, 5]
path = [
  [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0],  # Room 0: Bunnies
  [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],  # Room 1: Bunnies
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],  # Room 2: Intermediate room
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6],  # Room 3: Intermediate room
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 4: Escape pods
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 5: Escape pods
]
Then in each time step, the following might happen: 0 sends 4/4 bunnies to 2 and 6/6 bunnies to 3 1 sends 4/5 bunnies to 2 and 2/2 bunnies to 3 2 sends 4/4 bunnies to 4 and 4/4 bunnies to 5 3 sends 4/6 bunnies to 4 and 4/6 bunnies to 5

So, in total, 16 bunnies could make it to the escape pods at 4 and 5 at each time step. (Note that in this example, room 3 could have sent any variation of 8 bunnies to 4 and 5, such as 2/6 and 6/6, but the final solution remains the same.)

I have tried to re-write my code multiple times but I do not understand what I am doing wrong.

,How to repeat function in Python depending on output? [duplicate],"Recently I've got a small problem with if else statement. Namely I want to create a function that asks user for input whether he wants to read the file that script has created or not, so if the input is correct function does its thing however when input is incorrect I want it to revert to question again.

Here's the code:

def read_the_file(output):

,Why not allow an external interface to provide hashCode/equals for a HashMap?,"With a TreeMap it's trivial to provide a custom Comparator, thus overriding the semantics provided by Comparable objects added to the map. HashMaps however cannot be controlled in this manner; the functions providing hash values and equality checks cannot be 'side-loaded'.

I suspect it would be both easy and useful to design an interface and to retrofit this into HashMap (or a new class)? Something like this, except with better names:

  interface Hasharator<T> {
    int alternativeHashCode(T t);
    boolean alternativeEquals(T t1, T t2);
  }

  class HasharatorMap<K, V> {
    HasharatorMap(Hasharator<? super K> hasharator) { ... }
  }

  class HasharatorSet<T> {
    HasharatorSet(Hasharator<? super T> hasharator) { ... }
  }
The case insensitive Map problem gets a trivial solution:

 new HasharatorMap(String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_EQUALITY);
Would this be doable, or can you see any fundamental problems with this approach?

Is the approach used in any existing (non-JRE) libs? (Tried google, no luck.)

,Linq query to sum values from tables,"I have a LINQ query, which takes an invoice, looks up the quantity and unit price of each item attached, and in another linked table, looks up any payments made against the invoice.

Currently this is:

from i in Invoices
select new
{
i.InvoiceId, i.CustomerName,
Items =
    from it in InvoiceItems
    where i.InvoiceId == it.InvoiceId 
    select new { 
    it.Item, 
    it.Quantity, 
    it.UnitPrice,
    SubPrice=it.Quantity*it.UnitPrice
    },
Payments = 
    from pi in PaymentInvoices
    where i.InvoiceId == pi.InvoiceId 
    select new {
    SumPayments=pi.AmountAllocated
    }
}
This shows the following results:

screenshot of results

How do I change this LINQ query to show just the sum of SubPrice and SumPayments (ie:

Invoice 11: SubPrice= 90.00 SumPayments= 24.00

Invoice 12: SubPrice=175.00, SumPayments=175.00

Thank you for any help,

,Custom markers not showing on some devices (Google Maps Android SDK),"I have Google Maps SDK running with custom markers on an android app. Everything works fine on our test phones -- an S3, an S5 and a DROID. However, when I run the app on Nexus 5 hardware, one type of custom marker stops showing up on the map.

While the markers are not showing up, they are still being drawn on the map. We can tap where the marker is supposed to be and it will perform desired behavior.

We're super confused about this, especially because another custom marker (that is very similar) works fine. Other than hardware, the only other difference between our test phones and the Nexus 5 is that the Nexus is running Android 6.0, vs 5.x and 4.x for our test phones.

Any insight would be super appreciated!

Edit: Here is the code where we draw the markers:

Where mMap is a Google Map:

mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions()
                .position(position)
                .title(title)
                .icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromBitmap(annotationIcon)))

I think this is because my port is used. My port 8080 is used so I try the port 8181 I have no application on the port 8181

in the tomcat server.xml I set the port to 8181 but the problem persist

I find this post:

Alternate port for Tomcat (not 8080) when starting with Maven?

,`cabal-install` refuses to solve conflicting `ghc` and `containers` versions,"1

This repository contains a reproduction for an annoying error I got while using doctest in a test-suite.

  , containers == 0.5.10.2
Note that doctest depends transitively depends on ghc-8.0.2, which itself depends on containers-0.5.7.1, conflicting with my own constraints. That's basically what cabal install is trying to tell me:

...and many more of these.

I would like to get rid of all these signs/images and to keep only the letters (and punctuation) in the different languages.

I tried to clean the signs using the EmojiParser library:

String withoutEmojis = EmojiParser.removeAllEmojis(input);
The problem is that EmojiParser is not able to remove the majority of the signs. The ♦ sign is the only one I found till now that it removed. Other signs such as ✪ ❉ ★ ✰ ❈ ❧ ✂ ❋ ⓡ ✿ ♛ 🔥 are not removed.

Is there a way to remove all these signs from the input strings and keeping only the letters and punctuation in the different languages?","java

,C# List<> Add() method performance,"I am working with a List<> collection, adding new objects to the collection inside 2 nested loops. There are some 500000 items added to the collection, after the loops finish to execute.

At first, the addition operation runs well, but soon after there can be noticed a decrease in performance, for the last thousands of elements, the delay time is unbearable.

I have tried various tricks (initializing the collection with a certain size - 500000), replacing the List<> with a LinkedList<> collection, but it didn't help too much.

Can you recommend me a tip to solve the problem? I am interesting in changing the structure with a more optimized one - LinkedList<> for instance performs better than List<> with operations such as addition.

Small description of the method: - the method reads an object (a concurrent dictionary) and updates a list (in this case a LinkedList) with the forecasts corresponding to a certain article.

The concurrent dictionary object is constantly updated from various threads that access it concurrently.

The list is initialized with null predictions corresponding to all the articles; thus, for instance, if you have 700 articles, in the beginning the list will be populated with 700 blank forecasts.

As the concurrent dictionary is updated by one of the computing threads, it raises an event which calls the method mentioned above, which at its turn, updates the list (prediccionList).

The maximum number of records which could be hold in the prediccionList (in this case) is about 500000 records, but the loss in performance could be noticed after adding some 40000 records in the list.

The code might seem a bit rusty, as I have tried various optimizations tricks (replace the foreach'es with for's, calculate the count's outside the loops, replace the List<> object with a LinkedList<> etc.). Finally I reached the conclusion that the part that slows down the execution time is the line ""prediccionList.Add(p);"".

The objects that are added to the list are instances of the Prediccion class; this object I consider not to be very heavy, it only contains 7 fields.

Memory usage
I attach the result from a memory profiling. The memory used doesn't surpass 256 MB, thus I don't believe the memory should be a problem here.enter image description here","c#

,How to save dates older than timestamp in PHP,"This should be an easy one but I just can't find the answer.

I have an input field in which the user enters his birthay date (DD.MM.YYYY) and with strtotime() I insert it into integer field in MySQL because it's faster that datetime (and I have a lot of records).

But obviously there will be users older than 1.1.1970 so the timestamp would be zero. On the webpage I want to show how old is the user. So if he is born in 1960 he would be 51 years old. I know that I could change MySQL field to DATETIME but still the PHP would be the one to calculate the age of user and it uses UNIX timestamp.

So, how should I organize it? Thanks!","php

,Estimate exponential cutoff in a power law distribution,"As I have been doing some social network analysis, I have stumbled upon the problem of fitting a probability distribution on network degree.

So, I have a probability distribution P(X >= x) which, from visual inspection, follows a power law with an exponential cutoff rather than a pure power law (a straight line).

So, given that the equation for power law distribution with exponential cutoff is:

f(x) = x**alpha * exp(beta*x)

How might I estimate the parameters alpha and beta using Python?

I know scipy.stats.powerlaw package exists and they have a .fit() function but that doesn't seem to do the job as it only returns the location and scale of the plot, which seems to be useful only for normal distribution? There are also not enough tutorials on this package.

,STL Map with a Vector for the Key,"I'm working with some binary data that I have stored in arbitrarily long arrays of unsigned ints. I've found that I have some duplication of data, and am looking to ignore duplicates in the short term and remove whatever bug is causing them in the long term.

I'm looking at inserting each dataset into a map before storing it, but only if it was not found in the map to start with. My initial thought was to have a map of strings and use memcpy as a hammer to force the ints into a character array, and then copy that into a string and store the string. This failed because a good deal of my data contains multiple bytes of 0 (aka NULL) at the front of the relevant data, so a majority of very real data got thrown out.

My next attempt is planned to be std::map<std::vector<unsigned char>,int>, but I'm realizing that I don't know if the map insert function will work.

Is this doable, even if ill advised, or is there a better way to approach this problem?

Edit

So it's been remarked that I didn't make clear what I'm doing, so here's a hopefully better description.

I'm working on generating a minimum spanning tree, given that I have a number of trees containing the actual end nodes I'm working with. The goal is to come up with the selection of trees that has the shortest length and that covers all of the end nodes, where the chosen trees share at most one node with each other and are all connected. I'm basing my approach off of a binary decision tree, but making a few changes to hopefully allow for greater parallelism.

Rather than taking the binary tree approach I've opted to make a bit vector out of unsigned integers for each dataset, where a 1 in a bit position indicates the inclusion of the corresponding tree.

For example if just tree 0 were included in a 5 tree dataset I would start with

00001

From here I can generate:

00011

00101

01001

10001

Each of these can then be processed in parallel, since none of them depend on each other. I do this for all of the single trees (00010, 00100, etc..) and should, I haven't taken the time to formally prove it, be able to generate all values in the range (0,2^n) once and only once.

I started to notice that many datasets were taking far longer to complete than I thought they should, and enabled a debugging output to look at all of the generated results, and a quick Perl script later it was confirmed that I had multiple processes generating the same output. Since then I've been trying to resolve where the duplicates are coming from with very little success, and I'm hoping that this will work well enough to let me verify the results that are being generated without the, sometimes, 3 day wait on computations.","c++

Adding more details:

The system is expected to work as client-server system in which the client works with the server in a request-response interaction model. The interaction ends when the client has no more requests.

Interaction example: client: request1; server: response1; client: request2; server: response2; . . . . client: closeRequest; server: closeApproved;

At this point the server exits following a client exit. End of example.

It seems that a solution like (assuming pipe is available) client < pipe | server > pipe would not work (please correct me) because in this arrangement the client produces one big request, the shell pipes this big request to the server, then the server produces one big response, and finally the shell pipes this big response to the client.","bash

0 <= i < m, k may be very large (up to 100,000,000),  m <= 300000
I want to find the sum. I cannot apply the Geometric Progression (GP) formula because then result will have denominator and then I will have to find modular inverse which may not exist (if the denominator and m are not coprime).

So I made an alternate algorithm making an assumption that these powers will make a cycle of length much smaller than k (because it is a modular equation and so I would obtain something like 2,7,9,1,2,7,9,1....) and that cycle will repeat in the above series. So instead of iterating from 0 to k, I would just find the sum of numbers in a cycle and then calculate the number of cycles in the above series and multiply them. So I first found i^m (mod m) and then multiplied this number again and again taking modulo at each step until I reached the first element again.

But when I actually coded the algorithm, for some values of i, I got cycles which were of very large size. And hence took a large amount of time before terminating and hence my assumption is incorrect.

Already this question has a dupe and it's pretty clear this is confusing for Python novices. I guess this is worst if Python is your only language, where type hinting and variable definition prior to initialisation in general might feel foreign. I imagine raising an error is impossible as this behaviour is deliberate and sometimes useful as explained in PEP 526, and you don't want to break compatibility. However, I wonder if the Python devs would consider adding a useful warning message for some cases. –

Does this answer your question? What are variable annotations in Python 3.6? –

You have accidentally written a syntactically correct variable annotation. That feature was introduced in Python 3.6 (see PEP 526).

Although a variable annotation is parsed as part of an annotated assignment, the assignment statement is optional:

annotated_assignment_stmt ::=  augtarget "":"" expression [""="" expression]
Thus, in context[""a""]: 2

context[""a""] is the annotation target
2 is the annotation itself
context[""a""] is left uninitialised
The PEP states that ""the target of the annotation can be any valid single assignment target, at least syntactically (it is up to the type checker what to do with this)"", which means that the key doesn't need to exist to be annotated (hence no KeyError). Here's an example from the original PEP:

d = {}
d['a']: int = 0  # Annotates d['a'] with int.
d['b']: int      # Annotates d['b'] with int.
Normally, the annotation expression should evaluate to a Python type -- after all the main use of annotations is type hinting, but it is not enforced. The annotation can be any valid Python expression, regardless of the type or value of the result.

As you can see, at this time type hints are very permissive and rarely useful, unless you have a static type checker such as mypy.

Shouldn't this require an = assignment operator then? The key doesn't exist. This just feels wrong to me. –

In this case, : is the assignment operator. We're just ""assigning"" a type annotation alone, not a key. I doubt there's any reason for allowing it, just an unintended side affect of adding the annotation syntax. –

@chepner It seems this is no side-effect imho. This is exactly what the corresponding PEP was designed to do. –

It's weird that it'll allow you to annotate a target that hasn't yet been defined though. If my very first line is x: str and immediately followed by type(x), the interpreter will raise a NameError. IMO the syntax should enforce the object is pre-defined, or is defined on the spot. This just introduces confusion. –

@Idlehands This defeats the purpose though. Having x = 'i am a string' prior to x: str makes the latter kind of redundant.. This shouldn't have been added at all. It was fine as comment; I never show it used one way or the other. –

The annotations are automatically stored in __annotations__ which is a dict. For x: y. y must be a valid expression, i.e. y, or whatever is on the right side of the :, has to evaluate. On the other hand x ,must, at a minimum be able to be a key, thus hashable.

In addition, the LHS cannot be a set, because sets are unhashable, >>> {2}: 8

SyntaxError: illegal target for annotation

nor a list: >>> [2]: 8

 [2]: 8 SyntaxError: only single target (not list) can be annotated

nor a tuple:

>>> (2,3): 8     (2,3): 8 SyntaxError: only single target (not tuple) can be annotated

,converting an image to png on upload,"When a user uploads a jpg/gif/bmp image, I want this image to be converted to a png image and then converted to a base64 string.

I've been trying to get this to work but I've hit a brick wall really, can anyone help me out please?

,Hide part of string,"I have a listBox that is presenting a list of string values in a UI.

These string values are presented like -

value|1
value|2
value|3

//etc
Where the integer value is the string ID stored in the database.

I have used a split function on the next page '|' to get the string and ID when its passed through for other methods.

Is there anyway I can hide the ID value in the UI however still have it present in the listBox so it is available on the query string?

The listBox is populated like this -

foreach (string x in values)
{

    ListBox3.Items.Add(x); // I want to hide the '|1' value in the listBox

}
EDIT I want to hide the ID of the value however have it available in the query string as the split function is happening on the next page. On original page there is a button like so -

protected void Button6_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {

        if (ListBox3.SelectedItem != null)
        {
            Response.Redirect(""About.aspx?term="" + ListBox3.SelectedItem);

        }
    }
Where ListBox3.SelectedItem is value|1 then on the next page I am splitting this. So I need this full sting to pass on the query string however only want the value part visible in the listBox.\","c#

,Choosing DB pool_size for a Flask-SQLAlchemy app running on Gunicorn,"<p>I have a Flask-SQLAlchmey app running in Gunicorn connected to a PostgreSQL database, and I'm having trouble finding out what the <code>pool_size</code> value should be and how many database connections I should expect.</p>
 
 <p>This is my understanding of how things work:</p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>Processes in Python 3.7 DON'T share memory</li>
 <li>Each Gunicorn worker is it's own process</li>
 <li>Therefore, each Gunicorn worker will get it's own copy of the database connection pool and it won't be shared with any other worker</li>
 <li>Threads in Python DO share memory</li>
 <li>Therefore, any threads within a Gunicorn worker WILL share a database connection pool</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>Is that correct so far? If that is correct, then for a synchronous Flask app running in Gunicorn: </p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>Is the maximum number of database connections = (number of workers) * (number of threads per worker)?</li>
 <li>And within a worker, will it ever use more connections from a pool than there are workers?</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>Is there a reason why <code>pool_size</code> should be larger than the number of threads? So, for a gunicorn app launched with <code>gunicorn --workers=5 --threads=2 main:app</code> should <code>pool_size</code> be 2? And if I am only using workers, and not using threads, is there any reason to have a <code>pool_size</code> greater than 1?</p>",python database sqlalchemy flask-sqlalchemy gunicorn,1
,"Flutter json Decoding _TypeError (type 'List<dynamic>' is not a subtype of type 'Map<dynamic, dynamic>')","<p>So this error I understand kind of what it is, and WHAT I need to do, but I don't understands HOW to do what I'm trying to do.</p>
 
 <p>So I'm using an html api server-call, which returns a jsonEncoded List of Map objects.</p>
 
 <p>The size of each list CAN (and will) change, so I cannot have a function that just checks and decodes the first few or something. Also each Map object may contain different information, so I can't go making it parse statically. I need to jsonDecode the entire list, and convert it BACK into a list of separate Map objects so I can use the information contained within the Map objects within the rest of my program.</p>
 
 <p>For privacy reasons, I CANNOT provide an example of the type of object I'm receiving, (Or anything similar) and I apologize for the inconvenience, and increased difficulty of attempting to answer the question.</p>
 
 <p>That said, I do know I just need to have a function that checks how many objects are in the list, splits the response.body into that many pieces, decodes each into a Map object, and adds it to a list, or array. </p>
 
 <p>Any information you can provide (Even if not specific code) would help, even if just telling me what commands I should look into. (Preferably with an example of their syntax, but not mandatory of course).</p>

,Calculate average in java,"EDIT: I've written code for the average but I don't know how to make it so that it also uses ints from my args.length rather than the array.

I need to write a java program that can calculate:

NOTE: I don't want to calculate the average from the array but the integers in the args.

Currently I have written this:

    count++;
    System.out.println(count);

,How to wait for a variable to return before the next function starts,"I have a simple function1 that does a http request to a google api and returns the $result. I then have another function2 that, if $result isset, should use $result to do some computing and then return $finalresult. .

My problem is that the call to the google api takes a couple of seconds and by the time $result is returned by function1, function2 has already returned $finalresult without taking into consideration $result.

What I am looking to do is to have function1 to run completely and return $result before function2 even begins.

Preferrably I am looking for a solution that is not simply using ""sleep()"" as this function will not guarantee that $result is actually returned. (Unless there is some way to loop a sleep(1) until $return isset, or something like that)

Sample code for the visual gals and guys

function1_geocode($address); // this function makes a http request to google and returns $result
function2_proximitysearch(){
  if (isset($result)){
    //inevitably by the time the script gets there, $result hasn't been returned yet therefore none of the ""some stuff"" code is executed.

,Can you assign a substring of a std::string to itself?,"I recently found the need to replace a std::string's contents with a substring of itself. The most logical function to call here I think is the following, from http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/assign/:

substring (2)      string& assign (const string& str, size_t subpos, size_t sublen);
    
     Copies the portion of str that begins at the character position subpos and spans sublen characters (or until the end of str, if either str is too short or if sublen is string::npos).

     str
         Another string object, whose value is either copied or moved.

     subpos
         Position of the first character in str that is copied to the object as a substring. If this is greater than str's length, it throws out_of_range. Note: The first character in str is denoted by a value of 0 (not 1).

     sublen
         Length of the substring to be copied (if the string is shorter, as many characters as possible are copied). A value of string::npos indicates all characters until the end of str.

However, I'm not certain if this is permissible, or if it can corrupt the string data. I know that memcpy(), for example, does not allow (or at least does not guarantee non-corruption in the case of) overwriting an area of memory with (a portion of) itself (see memcpy() vs memmove()). But I don't know if the above method has the same limitation.

More generally, can you please comment if I should have been able to figure out the answer to this question myself? There's nothing in the documentation I linked to that makes it clear to me what the answer to this question is, except perhaps the qualifier ""Another"" in the description of the str parameter (""Another string object""), which seems to imply it cannot be the this object, although I don't find that to be unequivocal. Is that a weakness in the documentation?","c++

,Returning a list of lists using python recursion,"I'm brushing up on recursion problems and have no issues when the problem statement asks to print values (eg. BST traversal where you print the node values), and similarly few issues when the problem asks to return a list of values (return a path between 2 nodes in a tree) but am having problems when there are multiple answers, involving multiple lists (or a single 2D list) to be returned. For example the problem asks me to return how many ways a child can reach the top of the stairs, assuming it can jump either 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. This is no problem and is solved below

def step_helper(steps):
    if(steps == 0):
        return 1
    elif(steps < 0):
        return 0
    else:
        return step_helper(steps-1) +
             step_helper(steps-2) + 
             step_helper(steps-3)

def find_num_ways(steps):
    count = step_helper(steps)
    print(count)

find_num_ways(10)
Similarly if I need to return a path from two nodes in a BST, returning 1 list is no problem

def another_path_helper(self, n1, n2):
    if(n1 == None):
        return [None]
    elif(n1 == n2):
        return [n1.data]
    elif(n1.data > n2.data):
        return [n1.data] + self.another_path_helper(n1.left, n2)
    elif(n1.data < n2.data):
        return [n1.data] + self.another_path_helper(n1.right, n2)
    else:
        return None

def another_path(self, n1, n2):
    path = self.another_path_helper(n1, n2)
    if(None in path):
        return None
    else:
        return path
However, I'm clueless on how I would return a list of lists. In the child-steps example, instead of returning the number of ways a child can climb the stairs, how could I return a list of paths, which would be a 2d list, where each entry would be a list of steps taken to get from bottom to top? Ideally I would not need to pass a list as argument to my recursive function since I've been told passing mutable objects to recursive functions is a bad practice and no different from using a static counter.","python-3.x

I'm wondering why the second printf changes the pointer i.
And, how does C initalize pointers? As far as I know, if a pointer is not initialized, it would have value Null which is equal to 0, correct? Why in the first output, the i was initialized?

EDIT: Following the suggestions from you guys, I made some changes:

#include <stdio.h>

main() {

  int * j;
  printf(""%p\n"", i);
  printf(""%p\n"", j);

,What does `*&` in a function declaration mean?,"I wrote a function along the lines of this:

void myFunc(myStruct *&out) {
    out = new myStruct;
    out->field1 = 1;

Now in a calling function, I might write something like this:

myStruct *data;
myFunc(data);
which will fill all the fields in data. If I omit the '&' in the declaration, this will not work. (Or rather, it will work only locally in the function but won't change anything in the caller)

If a variable is declared static in a function, will the same variable/same copy be used for all recursive calls of that function?

If the variable is not declared static (e.g, simply ""int x""), will each recursive call to the function have its own copy of that variable? If yes, is that the way it normally happens when a function is called from other function, including the recursive calls?

Does anyone know of a technical reason why you don't get an Array? Or why a StaticNodeList doesn't inherit from an Array in such a way that you could use map, concat, etc?

,Inner Join two tables when one column is a text and the other is number,"I have a program in access that is using some linked ODBC tables. I had originally had a query that contained the following INNER JOIN:

FROM Neptune_FN_Analysis 
INNER JOIN Neptune_prem ON Neptune_FN_Analysis.PremID = Neptune_prem.premice_id 
This worked just fine until the column Neptune_prem.premice_id got changed from a number to a text data type. So now I need a way to use an INNER JOIN on two columns when one is a number and the other is a text.

Please keep in mind that I am not allowed to simply change the data type in the table that the linked ODBC tables are looking at.

If this is impossible or a rediculous amount of code my other logical option would be to make a query to make a local table that I can edit with all of the same data in the Neptune_FN_Analysis table and in the code after that query edit the column I am joining with to type text.

,Store dynamic dropdown options with Python and Selenium Webdriver,"I'm trying to store address values generated by a postcode lookup and then create a list that I can use the python Random module to select a random value using random.choice

Scenario:

Enter postcode, click 'Search' - dropdown list is dynamically populated with available options.

I'm using a dictionary to store my form values as xpaths and then using the webdriver to find_elements_by_xpath or find_element_by_xpath.

Code looks something like this (not properly formatted, just reference):

__author__ = 'scott'

from selenium import webdriver
import random

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.maximize_window()
driver.get('https://www.somerandomsite')

pcList = ['BD23 1DN', 'BD20 0JZ']

#picks a random postcode from pcList#
driver.find_element_by_xpath(formFields['postcode']).send_keys(random.choice(pcList))

driver.find_elements_by_xpath(formFields['county'])

#####now need to store the values from county and select a random option from the list######

,What is the easiest method to remove the Millisecond's part of a DateTime.UctNow.TimeOfDay?,"I have a theory why the following code is not producing the results I need:

 endDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(1).ToShortDateString() + "" "" +    
      DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay.Subtract(
         new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 0, DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay.Milliseconds));
The processor must calculate the DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay.Milliseconds, and due to the time length of a single tick of the CPU (and the time to process this property and return a result), It does not denote that DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay.Milliseconds will subtract the exact amount of milliseconds specified by the DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay

I need to know, what is the simplest and most effective method to remove the amount of milliseconds from DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay, without having to use a huge amount of processor time? This application of mine is pretty big, and this problem is pretty simple. But when this application gets deployed, there are no room for it to be unstable. This milliseconds must be trimmed because it is sent to a stored procedure in SQL Server, and this specific stored procedure does not support milliseconds on DateTimes. I also run into this problem commonly, but I normally convert the date to string (which is a cast on its own), split the string at the full stop at milliseconds, and use the index position 0 to get the time i need. Is there a shorter, more effective way?

Stability and speed is most important to me.

,Why does the speed of memcpy() drop dramatically every 4KB?,"I tested the speed of memcpy() noticing the speed drops dramatically at i*4KB. The result is as follow: the Y-axis is the speed(MB/second) and the X-axis is the size of buffer for memcpy(), increasing from 1KB to 2MB. Subfigure 2 and Subfigure 3 detail the part of 1KB-150KB and 1KB-32KB.

Environment：

CPU : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5620 @ 2.40GHz

OS : 2.6.35-22-generic #33-Ubuntu

GCC compiler flags : -O3 -msse4 -DINTEL_SSE4 -Wall -std=c99

Graphs of memcpy speed showing troughs every 4k

I guess it must be related to caches, but I can't find a reason from the following cache-unfriendly cases:

Why is my program slow when looping over exactly 8192 elements?

Why is transposing a matrix of 512x512 much slower than transposing a matrix of 513x513?

Since the performance degradation of these two cases are caused by unfriendly loops which read scattered bytes into the cache, wasting the rest of the space of a cache line.

Here is my code:

void memcpy_speed(unsigned long buf_size, unsigned long iters){
    struct timeval start,  end;
    unsigned char * pbuff_1;
    unsigned char * pbuff_2;

    pbuff_1 = malloc(buf_size);
    pbuff_2 = malloc(buf_size);

    gettimeofday(&start, NULL);
    for(int i = 0; i < iters; ++i){
        memcpy(pbuff_2, pbuff_1, buf_size);
    }   
    gettimeofday(&end, NULL);
    printf(""%5.3f\n"", ((buf_size*iters)/(1.024*1.024))/((end.tv_sec - \
    start.tv_sec)*1000*1000+(end.tv_usec - start.tv_usec)));
    free(pbuff_1);
    free(pbuff_2);
}
UPDATE
Considering suggestions from @usr, @ChrisW and @Leeor, I redid the test more precisely and the graph below shows the results. The buffer size is from 26KB to 38KB, and I tested it every other 64B(26KB, 26KB+64B, 26KB+128B, ......, 38KB). Each test loops 100,000 times in about 0.15 second. The interesting thing is the drop not only occurs exactly in 4KB boundary, but also comes out in 4*i+2 KB, with a much less falling amplitude.

More graphs showing performance drops

PS
@Leeor offered a way to fill the drop, adding a 2KB dummy buffer between pbuff_1 and pbuff_2. It works, but I am not sure about Leeor's explanation.

,Split a string consisting of letters and numbers into parts,"I have a string consisting of alternating strings of lower-cased letters and numbers (integers or floats), which is of arbitrary length, and I wish to split it into parts, each of maximal possible size, such that a part will consist of either a string or a (string representing a) number.

I don't need to regard special forms of numbers, such as exponents, hexadecimal, etc.; just simple floating point or an integer.

A few examples:

>>> split("""")
()
>>> split(""p"")
('p',)
>>> split(""2"")
('2',)
>>> split(""a2b3"")
('a', '2', 'b', '3')
>>> split(""a2.1b3"")
('a', '2.1', 'b', '3')
>>> split(""a.1b3"")
('a', '.1', 'b', '3')
However, the following calls should raise some error:

>>> split(3)
>>> split(""a0.10.2"")
>>> split(""ab.c"")
My first attempt was using re.split. However, this attempt is quite naive, and it does not save the delimiters, in case I make these letters:

>>> re.split(""[a-z]"", ""a.1b3"")
['', '.1', '3']
My second attempt was using itertools.groupby. The problem is that it does not care about the form of the number, so, for example:

>>> islowalpha = labmda s: str.isalpha(s) and str.islower(s)
>>> [''.join(g) for _, g in itertools.groupby(""a0.10.2b"", islowalpha)]  # should raise
['a', '0.10.2', 'b']
Note: I don't care about the form of the output, as long as it is iterable.

Note: I've read this, but I could not adapt the solution to my problem. The main difference is that I need to allow only acceptable numbers, and not a simple list of digits and points.","python

1) The view that I'm attaching the gesture recognizer to has a two views and a label within it that each cover the entire frame of the view, however, I tried attaching the recognizer to the label, which is the topmost child item and it still doesn't work.

2) Both the function that adds the recognizer and the function that is called on the tap are contained in an NSObject file. I have a variety of interconnected functions that I want to be able to call from multiple view controllers and would prefer to keep this in the separate NSObject file. The process worked when I had everything in a UIViewController file and stopped working when I moved the functions to the NSObject file.

,WPF Application - can't display data from a list in a datagrid,"I'm a newbie with WPF and c# and have a (probably very simple) problem.

I'm coding a small application, and i'm trying to read data from a database, format it into a list, and display in a datagrid. Ive debugged it, and it I've successfully read the database, and all the data is in the list (cd_list), but it's not passing the data to the datagrid.

Below is my XAML:

<DataGrid Name=""DataGrid"" AutoGenerateColumns=""false"" RowHeaderWidth=""0"" Width=""240"" >
            <DataGrid.Columns>
                <DataGridTextColumn Header=""Name"" ></DataGridTextColumn>

                <DataGridTextColumn Header=""Employee""></DataGridTextColumn>
                <DataGridTextColumn Header=""Date""></DataGridTextColumn>
            </DataGrid.Columns>
        </DataGrid>
My code behind file does InitializeComponent, then does some work to get the data from a DB, and put it in a list of call_detail objects:

public class call_details
{
    public string name;
    public string details;
    public string employee;
    public string date;

    public call_details()
    {
    }
}
Declare list & call detail objects

   public call_details cd_rec = new call_details();
   public List<call_details> cd_list = new List<call_details>();
Add records to the list

   cd_list.Add(cd_rec);           
After this is done, I am trying to give the ItemsSource so that the data will show in the Datagrid, and have the following:

DataGrid.ItemsSource = cd_list;
but its not working. In the GUI, the Datagrid shows a grid, with the correct number of records that I expect, but they are all blank.So I guess that it is passing some info, just not the actual data.

,Node.js base64 encode a downloaded image for use in data URI,"Using Node v0.2.0 I am trying to fetch an image from a server, convert it into a base64 string and then embed it on the page in an image tag. I have the following code:

Note: This code requires ""express"" and ""request"". And of course, node. If you have npm installed, it should be as simple as ""npm install express"" or ""npm install request"".

Where am I going wrong that this isn't working correctly? I have tried so many different js base64 implementations and they all don't work in the same way.
