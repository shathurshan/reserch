How can I get the label to expand vertically to accommodate different quantities of text?

I have set lines to 0 in storyboard.  And I've experimented with different heights in the Size Inspector.  But the label is not adjusting and I am only seeing one line of text that ends at edge of label.

Would prefer not to use auto layout if possible unless there is no other way.

34558390,Why does the reverse() function in the Swift standard library return ReverseRandomAccessCollection?,"<p>Now that I've learned Swift (to a reasonable level) I'm trying to get to grips with the standard library, but in truth it's mainly ÎµÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬ to me!</p>

<p>So a specific question: I have an array of strings and I can call reverse() on it.</p>

<pre><code>let arr = [""Mykonos"", ""Rhodes"", ""Naxos""].reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>Now naively I thought I'd get back a type of Array from this. (Ruby for example has a similar method that you pass an array and get back an array)</p>

<p>But arr is now actually of type</p>

<pre><code>ReverseRandomAccessCollection&lt;Array&lt;String&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which is actually a struct, which conforms to CollectionType:</p>

<pre><code>public struct ReverseRandomAccessCollection&lt;Base : CollectionType where Base.Index : RandomAccessIndexType&gt; : _ReverseCollectionType
</code></pre>

<p>This means I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>for item in arr {
  print(item)
}
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't do</p>

<pre><code>print(arr[0])
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this designed to be this way?</p>

<p>Dictionaries in Swift also implement CollectionType, so I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>let dict = [""greek"" : ""swift sometimes"", ""notgreek"" : ""ruby for this example""].reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>But dictionaries are not ordered like arrays, so why can I call reverse() on dicts?</p>

I am programming an 8*8 LED Matrix, and currently have a semi-working code that uses a joystick to control a dot on screen. Only problem is: its nearly 1000 lines long. It's equivalent to writing an 1000 page essay only saying ""Pig, blanket, market"" over and over again until I get to the actual logic involved.

My friend suggested to make it shorter, I could make a function which returns a byte.

34561323,Android: Create bigger Floating Action Button with bigger icon,"<p>I want to create a bigger Floating Action Button (FAB), more than the usual 56 dp, with a bigger icon inside.
(For my purpose an icon will never be self-explanatory so I will create a png-file containing a short text and use this png as icon.)</p>

<p>Increasing the size of the FAB works fine:<br>
as i don't use the mini-FloatingActionButton, i redefined the mini-button-size.<br>
in my <strong>layout-xml</strong> i specify: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton
    ...
    app:fabSize=""mini""
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>and in the <strong>dimensions.xml</strong> i redefine the size for the mini-fab: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;dimen name=""fab_size_mini""&gt;80dp&lt;/dimen&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I didn't manage to get a bigger icon on the FAB.
I tried icons with different dp's from the material icons library - no success. Also setting a padding on the FAB-layout did not work.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

34564253,How to make Xcode automatically conform to a protocol,"<p>When I use a prototype table view, I always have to conform to the protocol <code>TableViewDataSource</code>. I always forget what methods I need to implement, so I have to look at the source of the protocol every time. This is really time consuming.</p>

<p>I think Xcode must have a feature that automatically implements the needed methods for you, right? Just like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I want to know where can I find this feature. If there's isn't, is there a workaround for this? At least I don't have to open the source code of the protocol each time I conform to it.</p>

<p>If you don't understand what I mean, here's some code:</p>

<p>I have a protocol</p>

<pre><code>protocol Hello {
    func doStuff ()
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I conform to it,</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass: Hello {

}
</code></pre>

<p>I often don't remember the names of the methods that I need to implement. If Xcode has a feature that turns the above code, into this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass: Hello {
    func doStuff () {
        code
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you understand what I mean? I just want to ask where to find such a feature.</p>

<ol>
<li>the <strong>Date</strong> should be every Monday (at this point, holidays scenario should be considered when Monday is not a trading day, we should apply the first trading day in current week as the Date).</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong> should be Monday's (or the first trading day of current week) Open.</li>
<li><strong>Close</strong> should be Friday's (or the last trading day of current week) Close.</li>
<li><strong>High</strong> should be the highest High of trading days in current week.</li>
<li><strong>Low</strong> should be the lowest Low of trading days in current week.</li>
<li><strong>Volumn</strong> should be the sum of all Volumes of trading days in current week.</li>

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

I have a few questions:

(1) Can Min-Max notation be used in case of any relationships, or, just when there is an indication for that in the description?

(2) Are my many-to-many relationships portrayed correctly here?

(3) Could I properly portray the relationships among Account vs Account Statement vs StatementID? 

(4) As per my assumption, Is Account Statement really a weak entity and is `Has` really a weak relation that is dependent on Statement ID? Is issue-date a weak key?

34614653,Is the arguments object supposed to be an iterable in ES6?,"<p>In ES6, I was trying to use the <code>arguments</code> object as an iterable when passed to the <code>Set</code> constructor.  It works fine in IE11 and in Chrome 47.  It does not work in Firefox 43 (throws a <code>TypeError: arguments is not iterable</code>).  I've looked through the ES6 spec and cannot really find a definition of whether the <code>arguments</code> object should be an iterable or not.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I was trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>function destroyer(arr) {
  var removes = new Set(arguments);
  return arr.filter(function(item) {
    return !removes.has(item);
  });
}

// remove items 2, 3, 5 from the passed in array
var result = destroyer([3, 5, 1, 2, 2], 2, 3, 5);
log(result);

<p>FYI, I know there are various work-arounds for this code such as copying the arguments object into a real array or using rest arguments.  This question is about whether the <code>arguments</code> object is supposed to be an <code>iterable</code> or not in ES6 that can be used anywhere iterables are expected.</p>

<p>By doing this the style-loader will inject a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element into the DOM. However, the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> will not be in the virtual DOM and so if doing server side rendering, the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> will be omitted.

34616725,C: non-NULL terminated unsigned char *,"I saw [here][1] that it isn't possible to find out an unsigned char * length using strlen if it isn't NULL terminated, since the strlen function will go over the string but won't find any '\0', hence a run-time error. I figure that it is exactly the same for signed char *.

I saw a code snippet that was doing something like `int len = sizeof(unsigned char *);` but, as I understand, it only gives the size of a pointer - word size. Is it possible to use sizeof in another way to get the result or do I have to get the length somewhere else?

const int MAXCOL = 5;)

<p>Defer pushes a function call to a stack.

<pre><code>func main() {

34634659,How to properly autostart an asp.net application in IIS10,"<p>I'm trying to get my ASP.NET application to automatically start whenever the application pool is running.</p>

<p>As per the lots and lots of references online I have already done the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the Application Pool to <code>StartMode=AlwaysRunning</code></li>
<li>Set the site in question (that belongs to beforementioned Pool) to <code>preloadEnabled=true</code></li>
<li>Install the <code>Application Initialization</code> feature to the Windows installation</li>
<li>Add the <code>&lt;applicationInitialization&gt;</code> node to the web.config's <code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;</code> node</li>
</ul>

<p>The web application is based on Owin and has a simple log4net logging statement in it's <code>Startup.Configuration()</code> method. Now when restarting IIS I see that the w3svc.exe process is running, so I know the <code>StartMode=AlwaysRunning</code> is working. There are however no logging messages in the log file.</p>

<p>Navigating to any url (even a nonexisting one) in the application will start the app and add the log line.</p>

<p>Because of the actual work that's done in the startup of the application I really want the application to truly preload, but I seem to be unable to get it done.</p>

<p>Searching this site I have unfortunately not been able to find a solution. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

34636644,Creating a Program to pick out random strings from an array,"<p>So, i wanted to create a program that picks out simple strings from an array, it sounded pretty simple to me but then i ran into problems. Here's what i wrote:</p>

job1 = jobs[rand()%7];
job2 = jobs[rand()%7];
job3 = jobs[rand()%7];

cin &gt;&gt; pickjob;
//Rest of code is below, i'll put it in if you need it ;)

<p>Let's say some file calls func1() below, which modifies the static global variable data and then calls func2() which modifies it again.</p>

I usually use:
H = padarray(2,[2 2]) - fspecial('gaussian' ,[5 5],2);
sharpened = imfilter(I,H);

to sharpen images, but I can't use imfilter with the filtered image from the edge-preserving technique (I've been testing with the normalized convolution filter from the source code) that I'm interested in.

Can anyone advise me on what I can do to make use of this filtered image for sharpening/deblurring? Providing a snippet of code would be appreciated as well if possible.  ",<matlab><filter><dns><transform><edge-detection>,0

prevent submit if non pdf/image type attached show error message ""Only image or pdf can be uploaded"" and then a message stating this and preventing form submit at the bottom of the page in red just like the other errors.</p>

My code works fine for first 2 calls, then why it throws OutOfMemory in next call? Why first two calls works fine with the same size of data? 

I know their are many questions regarding  OutOfMemory error. But, I want to know that how android allocates the heap size? Does it depends on the free memory of device? Does the size of heap reduced by android when the size of app data increase or it remains same?

34675045,Should subscribeOn and observeOn only be invoked by the final subscriber?,"<p>The <a href=""http://www.introtorx.com/content/v1.0.10621.0/15_SchedulingAndThreading.html"">Scheduling and Threading</a> section of <em>Intro to Rx</em> says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the use of SubscribeOn and ObserveOn should only be invoked by the final subscriber</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also says that in an UI application, the presentation layer, which is normally the final subscriber, should be the one to invoke these methods.</p>

<p>I am wondering if the advice is solid, since I see some situations in which this is not convenient:</p>

<ol>
<li>For starters, I don't believe that the presentation layer should decide where an Observable coming from the data layer should be subscribed. In my opinion, the presentation layer should be unaware if the data is coming from a database, from a REST API, or from memory. For this reason, it's convenient for the data layer to call <code>subscribeOn()</code> before returning the Observable, passing the IO Scheduler or the immediate Scheduler as convenient.</li>
<li>If the presentation layer gets the Observable from some service or use case (which in turn gets it from the data layer) and this service decides that it needs to process the stream in some computation Scheduler, why should the presentation layer care about this?</li>
<li>What about a stream that is originally coming from the UI, so it needs to be subscribed in the UI thread. Then it will be sent to some service to do some work and finally come back to the presentation layer to be observed in the UI thread. That would require the UI stream to be <code>subscribeOn()</code> the UI Scheduler, then <code>observeOn()</code> some other Scheduler, and finally <code>observeOn()</code> the UI Scheduler. In this case, being able to invoke <code>subscribeOn()</code> and <code>observeOn()</code> only in the final subscriber would mean that the stream can only be processed in the UI thread.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there some good reason why I should sacrifice the architecture of my application and ignore Rx's ability to easily switch threads by invoking these two methods only by the final subscriber?</p>

34686287,Automating CSV file merging and cleaning preferably by using Batch or Powershell,"I'm not a code guy and have spent whole day trying to get this done without success, hoping I can get some help from the experts. 

I have a folder called Vehicles, within which are two sub-folders - Automobiles and Trucks. Each of sub-folders contain two CSV files which have identical (to that sub-folder) headers/structure.
What I'm trying to accomplish:

1. Take the two CSV files in Automobiles folder merge them without duplicating headers and name the merged file as Automobiles.csv
2. Delete all rows in Automobiles.csv where 6th column (header is Fuel_Type) is ""Diesel"" (without the quotes) then move the file from sub-folder to main Vehicles folder.
3. Take the two CSV files in Trucks folder merge them without duplicating headers and name merge file as Trucks.csv
3. For merged file in trucks folder remove all rows where 6th column (header is ""Fuel_Type"") is ""Diesel"" (without the quotes) then move the file from sub-folder to main Vehicles folder.
Obviously if someone can help with 1 and 2 I can manipulate it for 3 and 4.
5. BONUS POINTS :) take the Automobiles.csv and Trucks.csv files and create Vehicles.xls file with Automobiles and Trucks tabs.

Few details - files are pretty large, each CSV can up to 350 thousand rows x 150 columns and be 200 MB in size each. All the Batch scripts that I tried to put together removing headers seemed to freeze with larger files.

Due to user permissions  on work computers would strongly prefer to use something that is native to Windows7/8 and doesn't require additional software, but would consider other options if nothing native is available.

Thanks in advance!

34698074,Securing a PHP Server from a Hijacker,"<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> I'm implementing a PHP Server without HTTPS/SSL.  On it, I want to authenticate that the user making calls to server is valid assuming that the communication between the app and the server is being watched by a hijacker (hacker with a network sniffer).  I further assume that the hijacker is an app owner trying to figure out how the app communicates with the server in order to hack my system.  I will have no control on who is an app owner.</p>

<p>What I have implemented so far is that the app needs to start a session before they can any work against the server.  To do this the app first sends a request to the server with a randomly generated code, and an authorization number, and the server responds with a security token.  The authorization number is based on the code and some other secret information in the app.  On subsequent calls the app regenerates the code and uses the token plus other secret information recalculate an authorization number (it never retransmits the token to the server either).  This is how each call is validated.</p>

<p>It's set up so that the calling parameters of one call cannot be reused the next time, so that if a hijacker can see the message used within a session, they cannot do anything with it.  Using them simply indicates that the call is ""not authorized"".  I'm 99% sure I've plugged all the related holes to the session communication, such that the hijacker cannot invade my environment.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> The hijacker will see the original session request, reuse those parameters to get a new session and use them to eventually figure out how the session calls the work.  </p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What strategy would you employ to validate that it is only my app talking to the server during the initial session request and not a hijacker impersonating my app in order to start a session?  </p>

<p>Note: Saving the session start parameters is unrealistic.  One idea I have is to embed the ""GMT time + N seconds"" into the randomly generated code then test to see if the server's GMT &lt; app's GMT+N; this way the randomly generated code become invalid within N seconds.</p>

However, when I run the same codebase on my machine, it doesn't work! I can see that those two values are properly attached to the `scope`. But when I try to log them to the console, it shows `undefined`. Why? You can see what I mean in the screenshot below. Very weird indeed.

34744742,Should I make my code dependent on external libraries?,"<p>Tl;dr: Stick to the bold text.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong> provided by others can <strong>save</strong> a lot of <strong>programming time</strong>, because one does not have to solve problems that others already did. Furthermore, they often perform certain tasks much <strong>more efficient</strong> than one could ever achieve by oneself.</p>

<p>On the downside one adds a <strong>dependency</strong> to the program which can cause <strong>problems with licensing, compiling</strong> on other machines and so on. Also developments in the libraries may interfere with developments in ones own code. In extreme cases one is after some time <strong>restricted</strong> to the <strong>functionalities</strong> the library provides meaning that even a small extension might require the programmer to rewrite half of the library. In such a case one may rather want to <strong>exchange the library</strong> with a different one.</p>

<p>At this point one can be in big <strong>trouble</strong> if the whole code is cluttered with calls to the library. To prevent problems like this one can right from the start write a <strong>wrapper</strong> around the external library so that a library change reduces to changing the wrapper and no other code needs to be touched - in theory.</p>

<p>In practice, however, the <strong>interfaces</strong> through which the wrapper is called may <strong>not</strong> be <strong>compatible</strong> with the ""new"" library. Also a library might use <strong>data structures</strong> that are <strong>not</strong> directly <strong>compatible</strong> with the data types in ones own program. Then data needs to be reorganized and probably a lot of copying happens which was not necessary before.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How can I avoid trouble with changing libraries?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Should I always wrap the functions external libraries provide?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Should I wrap data objects of external libraries as well?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Or should I instead completely decide for a library and stick with it?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>I work on a huge program in which problems of linear algebra are ubiquitous. Recently, we started to switch to Eigen, an efficient library with broad linear algebra functionalities. Eigen comes with its own data objects. Now there are tons of <code>std::vector&lt;double&gt;</code> objects present in the code which would need to be replaced with Eigen's <code>VectorXd</code> to be able to nicely work with Eigen. It would be a hell of a work to do all these replacements. However, it would probably be even more work to undo these changes if Eigen at some points turns out to be not the ideal solution. Now I'm not sure whether writing an own vector class which just wraps the Eigen data type would actually reduce the effort if the library will be exchanged someday, or whether I will just produce more problems that way.</p>

35751736,Seeking in HTML5 video with Chrome,"<p>I'm having issues seeking in video's using Chrome.</p>

<p>For some reason, no matter what I do, <code>video.seekable.end(0)</code> is always 0.</p>

<p>When I call <code>video.currentTime = 5</code>, followed by <code>console.log(video.currentTime)</code>, I see it is always 0, which seems to reset the video.</p>

<p>I've tried both MP4 and VP9-based webm formats, but both gave the same results.</p>

<p>What's more annoying is that Firefox runs everything perfectly. Is there something special about Chrome that I should know about?</p>

<p>Here's my code (which only works in Firefox):</p>

<pre><code>      &lt;div class=""myvideo""&gt;
        &lt;video width=""500"" height=""300"" id=""video1"" preload=""auto""&gt;
          &lt;source src=""data/video1.webm"" type=""video/webm""/&gt;
          Your browser does not support videos.
        &lt;/video&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var videoDiv = $("".myvideo"").children().get(0)
videoDiv.load();
  videoDiv.addEventListener(""loadeddata"", function(){
    console.log(""loaded"");
    console.log(videoDiv.seekable.end(0)); //Why is this always 0 in Chrome, but not Firefox?
    videoDiv.currentTime = 5;
    console.log(videoDiv.currentTime); //Why is this also always 0 in Chrome, but not Firefox?
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Note that simply calling <code>videoDiv.play()</code> does actually correctly play the video in both browsers.</p>

<p>Also, after the movie file is fully loaded, the <code>videoDiv.buffered.end(0)</code> also gives correct values in both browsers.</p>

35756691,Android Support Library 23.2 vector drawables are blurry,"<p>The latest version of the Android Support Library (23.2) adds support for vector drawables. It appears to do this by rasterizing the vectors on the fly on platforms that don't natively support vector drawables.</p>

<p>However, the rasterize image seems to be a fixed size rather that dependent on usage. Here's an example.</p>

<p><strong>Vector</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;vector xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:width=""24dp""
        android:height=""24dp""
        android:viewportWidth=""24.0""
        android:viewportHeight=""24.0""&gt;
    &lt;path
        android:fillColor=""#FF000000""
        android:pathData=""M12,2C6.48,2 2,6.48 2,12s4.48,10 10,10 10,-4.48 10,-10S17.52,2 12,2zm0,3c1.66,0 3,1.34 3,3s-1.34,3 -3,3 -3,-1.34 -3,-3 1.34,-3 3,-3zm0,14.2c-2.5,0 -4.71,-1.28 -6,-3.22 0.03,-1.99 4,-3.08 6,-3.08 1.99,0 5.97,1.09 6,3.08 -1.29,1.94 -3.5,3.22 -6,3.22z""/&gt;
&lt;/vector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageView
  android:layout_width=""128dp""
  android:layout_height=""128dp""
  android:id=""@+id/imageView""
  app:srcCompat=""@drawable/vector1""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The vector is 24dp x 24dp. It's used in an ImageView that's 128dp x 128dp. On platforms that's don't support vector drawables, the resulting image is blurry because the vector is rasterized at 16dp and resized to 128dp.</p>

<p>The only solution I've found is to create a separate vector drawable for each intended size. It's pretty annoying to create a bunch of duplicate vectors with only the height and width changes. And that doesn't solve the problem if you want the drawable to fill_parent or be dynamically sized in some other way.</p>

<p>Having to define the dimensions of your vector images in advanced <em>almost</em> completely defeats the benefit of using vectors in the first place.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a true work around?</p>

35780397,Understanding Service Worker scope,"<p>I am trying to implement a <code>Service Worker</code> in a test page. My end goal is an application that operates offline. The folder structure is below</p>

<pre><code>navigator.serviceWorker.register('../static/mod/practice/service-worker.js').then(function(reg) {
    console.log('Registration succeeded. Scope is ' + reg.scope);
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in the console I see</p>

<p><code>Registration succeeded. Scope is https://example.com/static/mod/practice/</code></p>

<p>If my page is located at <code>https://example.com/practice/foopage</code>, do I need to make sure that my <code>service worker</code> scope is <code>https://example.com/practice/foopage</code>?</p>

<pre><code>navigator.serviceWorker.register('../static/mod/practice/service-worker.js', { scope: '/practice/foopage/' }).then(function(reg) {
    ...

<pre><code>Registration failed with SecurityError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The path of the provided scope ('/practice/foopage/') is not under the max scope allowed ('/static/mod/practice/').

<p>Hi guys, I am a high school student. Now I have Grade 11 Computer Science in school.
The question is, as you see, the teacher is ask for a math contest procedure.
He said we need to do at least 10 levels.
Level 1 has one random operator.
Level 2 has two random operators
...and so on.
Also, every time the participants answer correct, he/she will get one score, which is mean I have to write something to check the correct answer. I know I need to use for loop to do the ten levels, the fact is I already tried but I can't.................I'm going crazy.</p>

What happens if someone else registers one of the addresses like <code>something+1@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>I saw this reliably work for both <code>gmail</code> and <code>outlook</code>, I'm curious to know why that is the case? Is there is a technical reason why <code>mailservers</code> drop off these suffixes.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if StackOverflow is the best place for this question, please move this to another site on the network which may be a better fit if that is the case.</p>

35822405,An Object Reference is Required fo Access to Non-Static Member,"<p>I apologise, I know this question has been asked a thousand times before by C# beginners (of which I am one), but all the answers I can find say I need to either instantiate the class, or make it static. My class <em>is</em> instantiated, and I am trying to access the <em>instance</em>. Can anyone take a look at my code and work out what is going wrong?</p>

<pre><code>public class RocketSimMain {

    public RocketShip test = new RocketShip ();

35882955,C++ single else won't work with multiple if,"I'm writing a program that will take an 8 digit number as input by the user and will evaluate it so if any digit that appears more than 3 times will be labelled as ""unacceptable"", if any digit appears 3 or fewer times it is labelled as ""acceptable"".
So numbers:

41124535, 13134113, 24255411

would be labelled as acceptable, but numbers:

34233332, 31111412, 55551122

would be labelled as unacceptable.

My approach is if... else chains and nests. So far I've managed to make a chain work, but it can only compare the digits when they repeat up to 2 times. Then I have a nest, but it only works if I write the else part every step of the way, instead of just leaving one single else at the end. This is crucial since the else part in the end will take the algorithm to a new if else nest that will evaluate the rest of the 8 digit long number.

the beggining of the program:


    cout << ""\n\n\t Input 1st digit:"";
    cin >> A;
    cout << ""\t Input 2nd digit:"";
    cin >> B;
    cout << ""\t Input 3rd digit:"";
    cin >> C;
    cout << ""\t Input 4th digit:"";
    cin >> D;
    cout << ""\t Input 5th digit:"";
    cin >> E;
    cout << ""\t Input 6th digit:"";
    cin >> F;
    cout << ""\t Input 7th digit:"";
    cin >> G;
    cout << ""\t Input 8th digit:"";
    cin >> H;
    
    cout << ""\n\t The number is: ["";
    cout << A;
    cout << B;
    cout << C;
    cout << D;
    cout << E;
    cout << F;
    cout << G;
    cout << H;
    cout << ""]"";

the if else chain:

    if (A==B)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (B==C)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (C==D)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (D==E)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (E==F)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (F==G)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    if (G==H)
    cout << "" Inaceptable!"";
    else
    cout << "" Aceptable"";


then the nest with several else commands:

    if (A==B)
    {
    if (A==C)
    {
    if (A==D)
    cout << "" Unacceptable!"";
    else
    cout << "" Acceptable"";
    }
    else
    cout << "" Acceptable"";

35947434,Redux reducers -- changing deeply-nested state,"<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around how to change deeply-nested state in redux. It makes sense to me to combine reducers and change first-level properties of the state for those pieces. Where I'm not so clear is on how to change the state of a deeply-nested property.
Let's pretend that I have a shopping cart app. Below is my state:    </p>

<pre><code>{
    cart: {
      items: []
    },
    account: {
      amountLeft: 100,
      discounts: {
        redeemed: [],
        coupons: {
          buyOneGetOne: false
        }
      }
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a user enters in a code, let's say they can redeem the ""buyOneGetOne"" coupon and that value should become true. 
I have a reducer for cart and another for account. For a first-level property (like if I was clearing the cart's items), I would just do the following in my reducer:</p>

<pre><code>case 'EMPTY_CART':
  return Object.assign({}, state, {items: []});
</code></pre>

<p>For changing buyOneGetOne, however, it seems like I would first need to do an Object.assign on coupons (because buyOneGetOne was modified), then doing an Object.assign on discounts (because I had modified coupons), and then finally emitting the action so the reducer could do Object.assign on the account (because discounts has now changed). This seems really complicated and easy to do wrong, though, which leads me to believe there must be a better way.</p>

<p>Am I going about this all wrong? It seems like reducers are only used to modify the root level properties of the state (like cart and account) and that I shouldn't have a reducer that touches state inside the account (like a discounts reducer), because account already has a reducer. But when I only want to change one property far down the state tree, it gets complex to merge every object from that change all the way up the object chain to the child of the root...</p>

<p>Can you/should you have reducers inside of reducers, like in this case have a discounts reducer?</p>

    [Required]
    public DateTime ValidUntil { get; set; }
}

    }
}

36073370,"Append to line that does NOT start with whitespace AND that is followed, two lines down, by a line that begins with whitespace","I need to append the phrase `bar` to the character (occurring at the end of the subject line) `o`, but iff said line does NOT start with whitespace AND is followed, *two lines down*, by a line that DOES start with whitespace.

FYI, in my input file (an ASCII text file), all blank lines are truly empty lines, with no whitespace in them whatsoever.  There are no double-spaced lines in said input file.  All non-empty lines that do NOT start with whitespace are preceded by empty lines.  I'm not concerned about any last line/second-to-last line edge cases.  Finally, the solution must be able to be inserted into a BASH command line pipeline I've set up to process my rather ugly, 80's era DOS text input files.

Suppose I have the following file:

    foo
    
    third line foo
        
    fifth line foo
     this line starts with a space foo
     this line starts with a space foo
        
    ninth line foo
        
    eleventh line foo
        
     this line starts with a space foo
    
    last line foo

I want the output to look like this:

    foobar
    
    third line foobar
    
    fifth line foo
     this line starts with a space foo
     this line starts with a space foo
    
    ninth line foobar
    
    eleventh line foo
    
     this line starts with a space foo
    
    last line foo

Although I'm looking for a sed solution, awk and perl are welcome as well.  All solutions must be able to be used in a pipeline (as I mentioned above).  Also welcomed are solutions which handle a more general case (e.g. able to append the desired text to lines that end in various ways, including whitespace).

Now, for the backstory:

I recently asked a question similar to the subject question a few days ago (see [here][1]).  As you can see, I got some great answers.  It turned out, however, that I did not fully understand my problem, so I did not ask the correct question that would actually solve said problem.

Now, I'm asking the right question!

36110620,"Standard way to ""clamp"" a number between two values in Swift","<p>Given:</p>

<pre><code>let a = 4.2
let b = -1.3
let c = 6.4

<pre><code>a -&gt; 4.2
b -&gt; 0
c -&gt; 5

<p>I know I can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>let clamped = min(max(a, 0), 5)

<p>Or something like:</p>

<pre><code>let clamped = (a &lt; 0) ? 0 : ((a &gt; 5) ? 5 : a)

<p>But I was wondering if there were any other ways to do this in Swiftâ€”in particular, I want to know (and document on SO, since there doesn't appear to be a question about clamping numbers in Swift) whether there is anything in the Swift standard library intended specifically for this purpose.</p>

<p>There may not be, and if so, that's also an answer I'll happily accept. :)</p>

36112445,Golang blocking and non blocking,"<p>I am somewhat confused over how Go handles non blocking IO.
API's mostly look synchronous to me, and when watching presentations on Go, its not uncommon to hear comments like ""and the call blocks""</p>

<p>Is Go using blocking IO when reading from files or network?
Or is there some kind of magic that re-writes the code when used from inside a Go Routine?</p>

<p>Coming from a C# background, this feels very non intuitive, in C# we have the <code>await</code> keyword when consuming async API's.
Which clearly communicates that the API can yield the current thread and continue later inside a continuation.</p>

<p>So TLDR;
Will Go block the current thread when doing IO inside a Go routine, or will it be transformed into a C# like async await state machine using continuations?</p>

The problem may have been caused by a configuration change or by the
installation of another extension. You can get more information by examining the
file 'C:\Users\Q009\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\ActivityLog.xml'.



Restarting Visual Studio could help resolve this issue.



Continue to show this error message?

<p>Opening the activity log reveals the following error:</p>

<p>In order to 'solve' this I just go to AppData/Local/Microsoft and remove VisualStudio and VSCommon folders. This fixes it for a while allowing me to continue work on my projects. Until the issue randomly decides to come back again.</p>

<p>Again, to clarify the situation. It's not a migration problem or a problem with newly installed packages. I've had this setup for a while now and those projects were created using this very instance of Visual Studio.</p>

36136874,Spring properties that depend on other properties,"<p>I would like to have properties, that I can reference via @Value in spring beans, that can only be created dependend on other properties.
In particular I am having a property, that describes the file system location of a directory.</p>

<pre><code>myDir=/path/to/mydir
</code></pre>

<p>And by convention, there is a file in that directory, that is always called <em>myfile.txt</em>.</p>

<p>Now i want to have access to both, the directory and the file, via @Value annotations inside my beans. And sometimes I want to access them as Strings, sometimes as java.io.Files and sometimes as org.springframework.core.io.FileSystemResource (which by the way works very well out of the box!). But because of that concatenating Strings on demand is not an option.</p>

<p>So what I of course could do is just declare both, but I would end up with</p>

<pre><code>myDir=/path/to/mydir
myFile/path/to/mydir/myfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>and I would like to avoid that.</p>

<p>So I came up with an @Configuration class, that takes the property and adds it as new PropertySource:</p>

<pre><code>@Autowired
private ConfigurableEnvironment environment;

@Value(""${myDir}"")
private void addCompleteFilenameAsProperty(Path myDir) {
    Path absoluteFilePath = myDir.resolve(""myfile.txt"");

    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; props = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    props.put(""myFile, absoluteFilePath.toString());
    environment.getPropertySources().addFirst(new MapPropertySource(""additional"", props));
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, in my context I even created a PropertyEditor, that can convert to <em>java.nio.file.Path</em>s.</p>

<p>Now the problem is, that for some reason, this ""works on my machine"" (in my IDE), but does not run on the intended target environment. There I get</p>

<pre><code>$ javac.exe src\java\util\ArrayList.java -d mypatch

<p>After that I could launch JVM with <code>-Xbootclasspath/p</code> to replace original <code>ArrayList</code> with the patched one:</p>

<pre><code>$ java -Xbootclasspath/p:mypatch MyTestClass

i want something to make my git and docker hookup easier. what tools are there?</p>

<p>LONG:
you can use jenkins to watch a git repo. jenkins runs your build script and your test suite and then does a docker push.
but after the push nothing happens! you pull manually.</p>

<p>on github you can use travis in a similar manner (if travis now supports docker). for those not in the know, think of travis as ""jenkins online"" but after doing its thing it destroys the build environment - any artifacts etc must be sent somewhere else prior to destruction.
BUT I still need to pull manually.</p>

<p>finally, you can do docker automated builds. However, now I've lost control since even if my build fails the docker build still kicks off!</p>

<p>I think in an automated build I can set webhooks to do something after a new image is received by docker hub but this is now getting very long winded!</p>

The Problem is with the Printer i have chosen. I have purchased a iMZ320 Zebra printer.

I noticed your plugin can it be modified to work on both IOS and Android applications.

We are not using a desktop app, we only developed on android and iOS
Our target devices are Android 4/5/6 and iOS 7/8/9
We use the CLI to initialize project code, then switch to eclipse to continue development.

I am reading from a database and populating each row/column, but for some records, I want to merge the two columns into one cell and populate that as a row, then after that, continue the two column scenario. I want to issue a VBA statement to merge the two cells together to make one cell across the entire row. This is impossible to ""record"" as a new macro. I don't know what the row number is at run time, I only know the column numbers.

36630008,"When searching Issues or Pull Requests in Github, can you specify a date relative to ""today""?","<p><strong>Is there a way to search Pull Requests (and likewise Issues) on Github where you specify a date range relative to today?</strong></p>

<p>My team meets weekly with another team, and we like to present them a list of Github pull requests we've merged within the past week.</p>

<p>We can do a search for any items merged since a particular date with the filter:</p>

<p><code>is:pr is:closed merged:&gt;=2016-03-31</code></p>

<p>But this needs to be updated every week, which is less than ideal. (As you can see, it's already out of date :)</p>

<p>However I see no mention of relative dates in their support article on searching issues:
<a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/</a></p>

<p>Nor is there mention of relative dates in the search syntax article:

36632867,Can you fire hooks when checking out a branch?,"<p>When I switch the branches using</p>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>can I fire a hook action to do some housekeeping stuff?</p>

<p>I added new Java sources to a branch and then switched to other branch, compiled classes from previous branch were left in the directory. These classes started interacting as classes are in the classpath and spring noticed the annotation on the classes.</p>

<p>I would like to fire mvn clean command to ensure these kinds of problems don't appear when I switch the branches. </p>

<p>Is there a way to do this? </p>

36634809,"Building a list of dictionary values, sorted by key","<p>I have a python dictionary that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>attributes = {
    'size': ['s','m','l'],
    'color': ['black', 'orange'],
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to get a list of values. If I use <code>values()</code>, I get this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; attributes.values()
[['black', 'orange'], ['s', 'm', 'l']]
</code></pre>

<p>However, I want the resulting list of lists to be sorted by the dictionary key in reverse order -- ie, size and then color, not color and then size. I want this:</p>

<pre><code>[['s', 'm', 'l'], ['black', 'orange']]
</code></pre>

<p>I do not necesarilly know what the dictionary keys will be beforehand, but I do always know if I want them in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order.</p>

<p>Is there some pythonic way to do this?</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of seems... not very python-like:</p>

<pre><code>keys = sorted(attributes.keys(), reverse=True)
result = []
for key in keys:
    result.append(attributes[key])
</code></pre>

<p>It's hard to go from <code>attributes.values()</code> to all of that just to sort the list!</p>

36636345,"Gradle, rt.jar access restriction","<p>I am using a Gradle build that contains among other things:</p>

<pre><code>apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'maven'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'

repositories {
  flatDir { dirs ""${System.env.JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib"" }
}

dependencies {
  compile name: 'rt' 
}

<p>It builds, that's great, yet the eclipse plugin is giving me a hard time on the rt.jar classes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access restriction: The type XMLSerializer is not accessible due to
  restriction on required library
  /usr/local/apps/jdk1.8.0_11/jre/lib/rt.jar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I understand.</p>

<p>Now I know you will tell me to just not use those classes. But you know how it is, I'm working on an ancient project and I just need to make it work for now.</p>

<p>My first question is: where is that restriction info located at?</p>

<p>And obviously: How can I get around that? I'm thinking of uploading it as a artifact on my Nexus repo, anything easier than that?</p>
